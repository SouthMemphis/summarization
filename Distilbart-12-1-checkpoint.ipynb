      "   0  So you’ve tried to be nice, and that has gotten you nowhere. If you feel like you’ve tried being diplomatic, kind, and understanding and you’re no better off than you were when you started, then you may need to take a different approach. Sure, you may be a bit annoying by being a broken record and repeating what you want again and again, but who says it won’t help you get what you want?”  Continue saying what you want, or talking about what you want, until the person you’re talking to is so frustrated with you or annoyed that he just gives in. Sure, it won’t be pretty, but it’ll help you get closer to where you need to go. Just fold your arms over your chest and say what you want. Be firm in what you believe and don’t be ashamed of acting this way! If you’ve tried to be nice, then you need to try a different approach. Another way to be truly stubborn is simply not to budge until the person you’re with gives in to your demands. This can mean staying in your seat at a restaurant long after you’ve eaten your meal, staying at home when you and the person you’re with need to get going somewhere, or even stopping and sitting down on the ground wherever you want until you get what you want. Sure, this may embarrass the person you’re with, but if you really don’t care about that, then this may be the best way to get what you’re asking for!  This can be especially effective if the person is really depending on you to get up, like if you’re supposed to be giving him a ride somewhere. Sure, this may not be the most sophisticated approach, but it may be the most effective. Some people will quickly give in in the face of embarrassment. Another way to be stubborn is to just ignore the person who is telling you you can’t do a certain thing. Act like you literally can’t hear the person until he or she lets you have what you want. This can mean blankly staring at the person in front of you, as if you don’t hear him or her turning you down at all, putting your fingers in your ears and saying, “I can’t hear you!” or just shrugging and walking away. Sure, this isn’t the world’s most mature approach, but if you’re really determined to get what you want, then this may help you get it at any cost. Another way to be stubborn and to get whatever you want is to bargain with the person you’re asking for help. Think for a minute and see if there’s something you can do for the person, so it feels less like a give give, and more like a give and take. If you have some ideas for how you can be of use to the person, then this will make it feel more like an exchange than a case of you just getting what you want.  For example, you can ask your mother to let you hang out with your friends in exchange for doing the laundry over the weekend for her. This will make your question much more appealing. If you want to borrow your sister’s sweater, offer to let her borrow the new dress of yours that she really likes. Though this is a cheap trick, sometimes shedding a tear or two can help you get what you want, especially if you’re in public. If your parents, siblings, or person you’re with won’t let you get your way, try getting really upset, crying, throwing a bit of a fit, or just showing how much you want whatever you’re not getting. Not only will this emphasize how much you want to get whatever you’re asking for, but it will also have the bonus effect of embarrassing the person you’re with into letting you have your way.  If you don’t care about embarrassing yourself, try asking for whatever you want in an extra public place and then have a meltdown when you don’t get what you want so the person you’re with gets extra embarrassed. If this doesn’t backfire and make the person even more angry with you, it can actually be just embarrassing enough that you may win. You can practice your hissy fit in advance if you think that’ll make your act more convincing. At the end of the day, being stubborn is all about sticking to your guns and getting what you want—and what you deserve. If you lose sight of your goals or needs, then you’ll be likely to give in to people or to give up because it’s simply easier than creating conflict. However, if you repeat what you want and why you want it to yourself, or even write it down on a piece of paper and read it over periodically, then you’ll be more likely to be stubborn about what you want—and to get it.  Sure, it’s easier to shrug your shoulders and say that you’ll be okay with not getting what you want, but if that’s your attitude, then you’ll never be happy. Remember that being stubborn is a good thing when it comes to following your heart and asking for what you really want in life. Be proud of yourself for being firm, sticking up for yourself, and not letting other people boss you around.\n",
      "   1  You want your foot to be at a 45 degree angle with the edge of the deck. The outer edge of your foot should be right up against the edge of the brake.  If you’re regular footed (your right foot is dominant), your legs and feet should be turned toward the right side of the scooter. If you’re goofy footed (your left foot is dominant), your legs and feet should be turned toward the left side of the scooter. Your big toe on your dominant foot should be lined up with the groove on the inside of your other foot. The inner edges of both of your feet should be touching. Wrap your fingers around the grips so you have a firm hold on the handle bars. Use your back foot to propel yourself forward whenever you want the scooter to move. Place your foot back on the deck in the same position it was in before.\n",
      "   2  The Forest Longhorn Beetle and its larvae are only found on trees in the forest. Look for large bore holes that can be up to 10 mm (3/8 inch) across, much larger than most household woodworms. Note that tunnels will be very discreet and run against the grain of the wood. Waney Edge Borer woodworm can be found in wood that has bark on it, and is rarely found in homes. Look for borer dust with bun-shaped pellets around the bark areas from the boring holes. The holes are usually around 2 mm (1/16 inches) in diameter. Ambrosia Beetle woodworm is generally found in the forest; this woodworm can’t survive in treated lumber, and only lives outdoors. Unlike other woodworm species, the adult does the tunneling, going against the grain and deep into the wood.  Look for black-colored tunnels that are evident after trees are damaged or wood is cut (in a lumber yard, for example.) Wood Boring Weevil woodworm can be found in wood damaged by fungal decay. You can identify this woodworm by looking for tiny holes with ragged bore holes and coarse dust. Look for tunnels that run against the grain and often break the surface of the damaged wood. Powder post woodworm is generally found in seasoned hardwood, which is usually only found in furniture factories and lumber yards. These woodworms tunnel along the grain of the wood, and don’t attack old wood (wood that is more than 15 years old). Look for tiny entry and exit bore holes no larger than 2 mm (1/16 inch), and loose, flour-like dust. Deathwatch Beetle woodworm can be found in hardwood, (usually oak), that is partially decayed. Look for bore holes that measure up to 3 mm (1/8 inch) across, and boring dust containing large bun-shaped pellets that are visible without any magnification. If possible, inspect the interior of the wood; more extensive damage occurs inside the wood than what is visible externally.\n",
      "   3  It’s hard to concentrate on homework if you’re tired, hungry, or uncomfortable. Try to get plenty of sleep if you know you’ll have to do a bunch of homework the next day, and don’t try to work on an empty stomach or with a full bladder!  If you feel physically tense, do some yoga or light stretches before you begin to work. Doing breathing exercises can also help you feel more comfortable and alert. If you’re not already in comfy clothes, get changed before you start working. This may mean joggers, sweatpants, pjs, shorts, underwear, or even being completely naked. It's your choice. Your environment can make a big difference in how well you focus on your work. Before you begin doing your homework, find a spot that is quiet, well-lit, and gives you plenty of space to spread out.  You’ll want a place where you can sit comfortably, but don’t get too comfortable. If you do homework in bed or on a cozy couch, you may be tempted to fall asleep! If you have to work at home, ask anyone who lives with you to give you a little quiet time while you do your homework. If you’re constantly looking at your Facebook feed or checking your Instagram notifications, you won’t get much work done. Put your phone in a place where you can’t get at it easily, like inside your bag or in a desk drawer. Turn off notifications if they distract you.  If you can’t resist messing around on your phone or visiting time-wasting websites on your computer, consider installing an app or a browser extension that blocks tempting apps and sites. Don’t try to work with a TV or radio on. If you listen to music while you do your homework, choose something that’s quiet and not too exciting, like some gentle classical music. While you study, keep a bottle of water and some snacks on hand. Staying hydrated and eating healthy foods can help you wake up, focus, and stay alert. Choose foods that can help boost your brain power, such as:  Whole grains Healthy proteins, like fish, beans, or nuts Blueberries Leafy greens You’ll get burnt out and lose focus quickly if you try to work too long without a break. Try working for an hour to an hour and a half and then taking a 15-minute break. This will give your tired brain a chance to rest and recharge.  During your breaks, you can go for a walk, have a snack, do a little meditation, or even put your head down for a quick power nap. You can also use your breaks to reward yourself with a fun video or a quick game on your phone. If you’ve reached the point where you can’t stand to look at your assignment any more, take a break and then try switching to another task for a while. This way you can give your brain a break (and get some variety) while still being productive.  For example, if you’ve been working on an essay for an hour or two, take a break and then switch to doing some math problems. Don’t try to do more than one task at once, though. Trying to multitask will disrupt your focus and cause you to make more mistakes.\n",
      "   4  On the inside of your garment, there is a care label. Reading this label will give you an idea of what you can use on your garment safely. For example, an empty triangle is the symbol for bleach. If the triangle is black with a large “X” through it, you cannot use bleach of any sort. If the triangle is striped black and white, you can use non-chlorine bleach only. Before using any cleaning product or detergent, read the label. The label can help identify which products are best for which garment. It can also tell you if it is safe on the type of garment you are using. For example, a detergent with bleach will be best for a white garment, but may not be the best choice for a dark colored garment. Before putting anything on a stained item of clothing, do a test spot first. A test spot will allow you to check that you can use your stain removal solution on the clothing without causing permanent damage like changing the colour. The inside hem is a great location to test a solution because it is very inconspicuous. Before doing anything with your item, you should remove excess dirt or grass from the stained location. Blot, rather than rub, to try get the excess out. Rubbing will only cause the stain to move further into your clothing. Struggling to get some dirt off? Try holding the clothing taut between your fingers, and flicking from the inside of the garment. This should forcefully fling off any excess mud.\n"
